I’ve also build a multi-purpose autonomous robot that follows lines on the floor for the university. This was actually my first task as an employed student. It was so exciting!

And I’ve actually kept a blog of the build. Links to PART 1 and PART2.

You can find an interesting use case with this robot here.
