Was heavily involved in contributing to a popular magni_robot repo from Ubiquity Robotics - which is the main package to control and simulate their main product - Magni robot. The work involved porting the package from Kinetic to Noetic as well as redesigning the architecture to be more dynamic and user friendly.
