In January 2015 Laboratory for telecommunications decided to open a first MakerLab in Slovenia. It is the first open space in Faculty for any student to develop his/her project without needing to pay for tools or help! This is the true meaning of opensource and I am very lucky to be a part of it!


All our activity in MakerLab is updated on our facebook page and on our website. Come visit us if you are ever in Ljubljana, Slovenia, we will be happy to show you around!

Here is a list of some projects weâ€™ve done in MakerLab:

 - [Olympic countdown timer]()
 - [Froc]()
 - [RobertRos]()

Meanwhile, here are some pictures:
